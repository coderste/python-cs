# Project

Len's Slice (Python Lists)

You work at Lenâ€™s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. You are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some of your sales data.

### Notes

This project wasn't as full as sals-shipping but it still a good example of handling lists in python
