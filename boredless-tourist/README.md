# The Boredless Tourist

Welcome to The Boredless Tourist, an online application giving you the power to find the parts of the city that fit the pace of your life. We at The Boredless Tourist run a recommendation engine using Python. We first evaluate what a person’s interests are and then give them recommendations in their area to venues, restaurants, and historical destinations that we think they’ll be engaged by.


### Lessons

`version-1.py` is version 1 of this script where everything is pretty much hard-coded

#### Ideas for version 2?

- Allow user input via the terminal (other than name they can't say any destination or interests)

#### Ideas for version 3?

- Allow user input via the terminal
- Go off to some api (maybe Google) and return the attractions based on the destination input and interest input
